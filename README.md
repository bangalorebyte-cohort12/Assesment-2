Olive Oils Challenge

- Number of rows: 572
- Number of variables: 10

Description: This data consists of the percentage composition of fatty acids found in the lipid fraction of Italian olive oils. The data arises from a study to determine the authenticity of an olive oil.

Analysis notes: There are nine classes (areas) in this data, too many to easily classify. A better approach is to take advantage of the hierarchical structure in the data, partitioning by region before starting.

Some of the classes are easy to distinguish, but others present a challenge. The clusters corresponding to classes all have different shapes in the eight- dimensional data space.
